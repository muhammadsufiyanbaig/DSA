## Introduction
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Unlike linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues), trees represent hierarchical relationships between elements. Each tree has a root node, and every node has zero or more child nodes.

## Tree Terminology
- **Node**: Basic element of a tree, which may contain data and references to other nodes
- **Root**: Topmost node of the tree, with no parent
- **Edge**: Link between two nodes
- **Parent**: Node that has a child
- **Child**: Node that has a parent
- **Leaf/Terminal Node**: Node with no children
- **Internal Node**: Node with at least one child
- **Sibling**: Nodes with the same parent
- **Ancestor**: Any node reachable by moving up from a node
- **Descendant**: Any node reachable by moving down from a node
- **Subtree**: Tree formed by a node and its descendants
- **Depth of a Node**: Length of the path from the root to the node
- **Height of a Node**: Length of the longest path from the node to a leaf
- **Height of a Tree**: Height of the root node
- **Level**: Set of nodes at the same depth
- **Degree**: Number of children of a node

## Types of Trees

### Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as left child and right child.

### Binary Tree Types

#### Regular Binary Tree
A tree in which each node has at most two children, often referred to as left and right children.

#### Complete Binary Tree
A binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

#### Full Binary Tree
A binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children.

#### Perfect Binary Tree
A binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaves are at the same level.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary tree with the property that for each node:
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value

#### Types of Binary Search Trees
- **Standard BST**: Simple implementation with no self-balancing
- **Red-Black Tree**: Self-balancing BST with additional coloring property to ensure O(log n) operations
- **Splay Tree**: Self-adjusting BST that moves recently accessed nodes closer to the root
- **Treap**: Combination of a binary search tree and a heap where each node has both a key and a priority

### AVL Tree
A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees differ by at most one.

### B-Tree
A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

### Heap
A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
- Min-Heap: Parent nodes have values less than or equal to their children
- Max-Heap: Parent nodes have values greater than or equal to their children.

## Tree Traversal
Methods to visit all nodes in a tree:

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Preorder**: Root → Left → Right
- **Inorder**: Left → Root → Right
- **Postorder**: Left → Right → Root

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Level Order**: Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom

## Common Operations
- **Insertion**: Add a node to the tree
- **Deletion**: Remove a node from the tree
- **Search**: Find a node with a given value
- **Traversal**: Visit all nodes in the tree

## Applications
- Representing hierarchical data (file systems)
- Database indexing
- Syntax trees in compilers
- Network routing algorithms
- Decision trees in machine learning
- Priority queues
- Game AI (minimax algorithm)

## Implementation Considerations
- Recursive vs iterative implementations
- Memory allocation strategies
- Balancing techniques
- Serialization and deserialization

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Binary Search Tree (Average) | Binary Search Tree (Worst) | Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black) |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Search    | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(log n)                       |
| Insertion | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(log n)                       |
| Deletion  | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(log n)                       |
| Traversal | O(n)                         | O(n)                       | O(n)                           |

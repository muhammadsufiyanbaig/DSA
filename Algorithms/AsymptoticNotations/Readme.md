# Asymptotic Notations

## Introduction

Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to analyze algorithm efficiency by describing the behavior of functions as their input sizes grow toward infinity. They help us understand how algorithms scale and perform without getting bogged down in implementation details, hardware specifications, or constant factors.

## Common Asymptotic Notations

### Big O Notation (O)

**Big O** describes the upper bound or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time or space complexity.

- **Formal Definition**: f(n) ∈ O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n₀ such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ c⋅g(n) for all n ≥ n₀.
- **Meaning**: f(n) grows no faster than g(n).
- **Example**: If an algorithm has O(n²) time complexity, its execution time grows no faster than n².

### Big Omega Notation (Ω)

**Big Omega** describes the lower bound or best-case scenario of an algorithm.

- **Formal Definition**: f(n) ∈ Ω(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n₀ such that 0 ≤ c⋅g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n₀.
- **Meaning**: f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n).
- **Example**: If an algorithm has Ω(n) time complexity, its execution time grows at least linearly.

### Big Theta Notation (Θ)

**Big Theta** describes the tight bound where an algorithm's complexity is bounded both from above and below.

- **Formal Definition**: f(n) ∈ Θ(g(n)) if f(n) ∈ O(g(n)) and f(n) ∈ Ω(g(n)).
- **Meaning**: f(n) grows at the same rate as g(n).
- **Example**: If an algorithm has Θ(n log n) complexity, it grows exactly at the rate of n log n.

### Little o Notation (o)

**Little o** provides a stricter upper bound than Big O.

- **Formal Definition**: f(n) ∈ o(g(n)) if for every positive constant c, there exists a constant n₀ such that 0 ≤ f(n) < c⋅g(n) for all n ≥ n₀.
- **Meaning**: f(n) grows strictly slower than g(n).

### Little Omega Notation (ω)

**Little omega** provides a stricter lower bound than Big Omega.

- **Formal Definition**: f(n) ∈ ω(g(n)) if for every positive constant c, there exists a constant n₀ such that 0 ≤ c⋅g(n) < f(n) for all n ≥ n₀.
- **Meaning**: f(n) grows strictly faster than g(n).

## Common Time Complexities

| Notation | Name | Example Algorithm |
|----------|------|------------------|
| O(1) | Constant | Array access, Hash table insertion |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Linear search |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort, Heap sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Bubble sort, Insertion sort |
| O(n³) | Cubic | Simple matrix multiplication |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
| O(n!) | Factorial | Traveling Salesman (brute force) |

## Analyzing Algorithms

When analyzing algorithms:

1. **Identify the input size** (n)
2. **Count operations** that scale with input size
3. **Disregard constants and lower-order terms**
4. **Focus on the dominant term** as n approaches infinity

## Examples

### Linear Search Algorithm Analysis

```java
public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

- Best case: Ω(1) - Target is at the first position
- Worst case: O(n) - Target is at the last position or not present
- Average case: Θ(n/2) simplified to Θ(n)

### Comparison of Growth Rates

For large values of n:
O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)

## Practical Implications

- Asymptotic analysis helps choose the most efficient algorithm for large inputs
- Constant factors matter in practice but are ignored in asymptotic analysis
- Space complexity can be analyzed using the same notations
- For small inputs, simpler algorithms with higher asymptotic complexities might perform better
